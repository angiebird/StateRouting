<Purpose>
  Builds a simple, random connectivity mesh between a set of nodes.

  Takes a file with hostnames and outputs a list of lines that look like:
  srcip1 destip1
  srcip2 destip2
  ...

  The output graph is asymmetric, so if you see srcip1 destip1, you won't see
  destip1 srcip1.   The reason for this is to make it easier for the person
  using the graph to decide which node should initiate the TCP connection.
